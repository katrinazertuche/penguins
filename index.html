            <h1 class="purple-text">Penguins</h1>
            <p>Penguins (order Sphenisciformes, family Spheniscidae) are a group of aquatic flightless birds. They live
                almost exclusively in the Southern Hemisphere, with only one species, the Galapagos penguin, found north
                of the equator. Highly adapted for life in the water, penguins have countershaded dark and white
                plumage, and their wings have evolved into flippers. Most penguins feed on krill, fish, squid and other
                forms of sea life which they catch while swimming underwater. They spend roughly half of their lives on
                land and the other half in the sea.</p>

                class="left-graphic" alt="">
            <p>Although almost all penguin species are native to the Southern Hemisphere, they are not found only in
                cold climates, such as Antarctica. In fact, only a few species of penguin live so far south. Several
                species are found in the temperate zone, and one species, the Galápagos penguin, lives near the equator.
            </p>
            <p>The largest living species is the emperor penguin (Aptenodytes forsteri):[1] on average, adults are about
                1.1 m (3 ft 7 in) tall and weigh 35 kg (77 lb). The smallest penguin species is the little blue penguin
                (Eudyptula minor), also known as the fairy penguin, which stands around 40 cm (16 in) tall and weighs 1
                kg (2.2 lb). Among extant penguins, larger penguins inhabit colder regions, while smaller penguins are
                generally found in temperate or even tropical climates (see also Bergmann's rule). Some prehistoric
                species attained enormous sizes, becoming as tall or as heavy as an adult human. These were not
                restricted to Antarctic regions; on the contrary, subantarctic regions harboured high diversity, and at
                least one giant penguin occurred in a region around 2,000 km south of the equator 35 mya, in a climate
                decidedly warmer than today.</p>
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fd/Antarctic_adelie_penguins_%28js%29_21.jpg/2560px-Antarctic_adelie_penguins_%28js%29_21.jpg"
                alt="" class="right-graphic">
            <p>The number of extant penguin species is debated. Depending on which authority is followed, penguin
                biodiversity varies between 17 and 20 living species, all in the subfamily Spheniscinae. Some sources
                consider the white-flippered penguin a separate Eudyptula species, while others treat it as a subspecies
                of the little penguin;[10][11] the actual situation seems to be more complicated.[12] Similarly, it is
                still unclear whether the royal penguin is merely a colour morph of the macaroni penguin. The status of
                the rockhopper penguins is also unclear.

                Updated after Marples (1962),[13] Acosta Hospitaleche (2004),[14] and Ksepka et al. (2006).[15]</p>
            <p>Penguins are superbly adapted to aquatic life. Their wings have evolved to become flippers, useless for
                flight in the air. In the water, however, penguins are astonishingly agile. Penguins' swimming looks
                very similar to bird's flight in the air.[37] Within the smooth plumage a layer of air is preserved,
                ensuring buoyancy. The air layer also helps insulate the birds in cold waters. On land, penguins use
                their tails and wings to maintain balance for their upright stance.</p>

                                Zealand,[2] where it breeds on the Bounty and Antipodes Islands,[3] although previously
                                also known from Campbell Island.[4] It has black upper parts, white underparts and a
                                yellow eye stripe and crest. It spends the winter at sea and little is known about its
                                biology and breeding habits. Populations have declined during the last few decades of
                                the twentieth century, and the International Union for Conservation of Nature has listed
                                it as being "endangered".[5]</p>

                            <p>The Fiordland crested penguin was described in 1845 by English zoologist George Robert
                                Gray, its specific epithet derived from the Ancient Greek pachy-/παχυ- "thick" and
                                rhynchos/ρύγχος "beak".[4] It is one of six species in the genus Eudyptes, the generic
                                name derived from the Ancient Greek eu/ευ "good" and dyptes/δύπτης "diver". This species
                                is a medium-sized, yellow-crested, black-and-white penguin, growing to approximately 60
                                cm (24 in) long and weighing on average 3.7 kg (8.2 lb), with a weight range of 2 to
                                5.95 kg (4.4 to 13.1 lb).[5] It has dark, bluish-grey upperparts with a darker head, and
                                white underparts. Its broad, yellow eyebrow-stripe extends over the eye and drops down
                                the neck. It can be distinguished from the similar erect-crested penguin (Eudyptes
                                sclateri) and Snares penguin (Eudyptes robustus) in having no bare skin around the base
                                of its bill.[6] Female Fiordland penguins lay a clutch of two eggs where the first-laid
                                egg is much smaller than the second egg, generally hatches later, and shows higher
                                mortality, demonstrating a brood reduction system that is unique from other avian
                                groups.</p>

                            <p>The average Galápagos penguin is 49 centimetres (19 in) long and 2.5 kilograms (5.5 lb)
                                in weight. It is the second smallest species of penguin, after the little penguin.
                                Galápagos penguins have a black head with a white border running from behind the eye,
                                around the black ear coverts and chin, to join on the throat. They have grey-black
                                upperparts and whitish underparts, with two black bands across the breast, the lower
                                band extending down the flanks to the thigh. Juveniles differ in having a wholly dark
                                head, greyer on side and chin, and no breast band. Females are smaller than males.</p>

                            <p>The application of gentoo to the penguin is unclear. Gentoo was an Anglo-Indian term to
                                distinguish Hindus from Muslims. The English term may have originated from the
                                Portuguese gentil ("pagan, gentile"). Some speculate that the white patch on the bird's
                                head was thought to resemble a turban.[3]

                                It may also be a variation of another name for this bird, "Johnny penguin", Johnny being
                                Juanito in Spanish and sounds vaguely like gentoo.[4][5][6] The Johnny rook, a predator,
                                is likely named after the Johnny penguin.</p>

                                flattened into flippers for a marine habitat. Adults weigh on average 2.2–3.5 kg
                                (4.9–7.7 lb) and are 60–70 cm (24–28 in) tall. It has distinctive pink patches of skin
                                above the eyes and a black facial mask; the body upperparts are black and sharply
                                delineated from the white underparts, which are spotted and marked with a black band.

                                    coast of the Antarctic continent, which is their only habitat. They are the most widely
                                    spread penguin species,[2] as well as the most southerly distributed of all penguins,
                                    along with the emperor penguin. They are named after Adélie Land, in turn named for
                                    Adèle Dumont d'Urville, the wife of French explorer Jules Dumont d'Urville, who first
                                    discovered these penguins in 1840.[3] They obtain their food by both predation and
                                    foraging, with a diet of mainly krill and fish.</p>

                                (7.1–11.7 lb), with the weight varying on the time of year.[3] Males are greater in

                                brown; the chin and throat are white, as well, while the short bill is black. The strong
                                legs and the webbed feet are pink. Its short, stumpy legs give it a distinct waddle when
                                it walks. The chinstrap penguin's black back and white underside provide camouflage in

                                the Pinguino de Humbold National Reserve in the North of Chile, although its habitat
                                comprises most of coastal Chile and Peru.[2] Its nearest relatives are the African
                                penguin, the Magellanic penguin and the Galápagos penguin. The Humboldt penguin and the
                                cold water current it swims in both are named after the explorer Alexander von Humboldt.
                                The species is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN with no population recovery plan in
                                place.[3]

                                Humboldt penguins are medium-sized penguins, growing to 56–70 cm (22–28 in) long and a
                                weight of 3.6-5.9 kg (8-13 lbs).[4][5] They have a black head with a white border that
                                runs from behind the eye, around the black ear-coverts and chin, and joins at the
                                throat. They have blackish-grey upperparts and whitish underparts, with a black
                                breast-band that extends down the flanks to the thigh. They have a fleshy-pink base to
                                the bill. Juveniles have dark heads and no breast-band. They have spines on their tongue
                                which they use to hold their prey.</p>

                                measurements vary by subspecies.[2][3] It is found on the coastlines of southern
                                Australia and New Zealand, with possible records from Chile. In Australia, they are
                                often called fairy penguins because of their small size. In New Zealand, they are more
                                commonly known as fairy blue penguins or fairy penguins owing to their slate-blue
                                plumage; they are also known by their Māori name: kororā.</p>
